    <p> From as far back as I can remember I have been practicing wellneess and self care. My earliest self-care memory must've been in 8th grade or early on in High school,friends and I would place cucumbers over our eyes for 10 mins, simply because it was the thing to do according to Cosmo or whatever inappropriate magazine we were reading at the time. </p>
    <p>Fast forward to now, self care and wellness are everywhere and I love it. If there is something to try that is good for my body and cost under $5, I'm all for it. My tips have come from all over; my Mom, Pinterest, YouTube and the explore page on Instagram. Over the years I've created my own, simply mixing things togetther and giving it a try. I hope you find something you can use.</p>
